1.0,Run!!!! Never work here their turnover rate is horrible ,"Google the name is great but management is horrible and racist. I don't have much to say.

Was provided great direction and the tools needed to perform well. I have reinterviewed with Google many times since then but have not received a full-time offer.

5.0,It was a good job to have in a small community.,"My original manager was excellent, he knew what was going on at all times. He left the office and checked on you, he also made every effort to make employees feel appreciated. He had done the job, he knew that it wasn't always pleasant lugging that mail satchel around in rain, sleet, hail or snow.The last manager I had, never left the office. She managed by reading emails from headquarters. I have an excellent work ethic, I don't feel the company I work for owes me anything that I don't earn.The hardest part of the job as a carrier was probably delivering in deep snow, it was very taxing.The most enjoyable part was when it was sunny and 75, no better job to have."

4.0,Chill and relaxed driving work but little pay. (Google Street View),"Worked for Google streetview and was a cool and relaxed experience. You mostly just drive around with the maps they give you. Once you know how to operate the camera and gear, it becomes easy and straight forward. Every now and then someone decides to flip off the camera but most of the time it's just relaxed driving. The only problem is that they only pay you a little above minimum wage and that it's a temporary job."

Now if the meeting was in the office at that time, I can't say that I would have grown to love it but... We were on Chromebooks, tablets, and Google meet... All of which they provided, so my meetings like many of my other coworkers were from bed. As for the other task, I totally loved what I did because I felt like I was working with a real purpose in the world.

4.0,All depends on your team!,"I originally started at Google in the sales department. This particular team held an environment that was toxic, hostile, inferior anxiety inducing. The management was dysfunctional, superior and misleading. However, switching to the HR department, my experience was night and day. I had a phenomenal department head who was a leader, a friend and an encourager. This trickled down to the management and team support. Very welcoming, inviting, encouraging and understanding of work like balance. Had I left Google with just the sales experience, I would have blamed the entire Google culture for a poor experience which is not the case. Like most places, it all depends on your team and management!"

4.0,Ottimo,è una realtà che merita.Consiglio di provarci a tutti.
3.0,Fun place to work but leaves you feeling paranoid. ,"Google is one of those dreams everyone hopes to fulfill. It’s great the first year or two. But getting promoted is really a punishment. Yeah you get great benefits and decent pay. But management is hit or miss. You have a 50% chance of getting a toxic boss. And I mean bosses that make you feel like your life should revolve around them. It’s not micromanaged but more like a cult where you get sucked into the culture and feel guilty for ever looking for something better. They have kids and pets and family that you get emotionally invested and it’s hard to pull yourself out of a culture like that. You never know if an award is really an award or a way to manipulate and control you. Like I did this for you and you owe me now. It’s an emotional debt you can never pay. When you have a great boss, you feel the same level of paranoia where you aren’t sure if it’s corporate gaslighting culture or you aren’t appreciative enough. Tread carefully with this company. "

5.0,Best Workplace,"Google is a great work place. They pay well and respect their employees. Team change is flexible, your manager can stop your moving if your tenure in the current team is more than a year. You can make impact doing what interests you. This makes Google the best place to work "
4.0,Great benifits,Great pay and benifits! Plenty of vacation time and great office space. Getting a promotion can be difficult due to needing community contributions and having done high profile work. 
4.0,"Good pay, limited growth, a lot of bureaucracy ",Company pays very well and has a lot of benefits and perks. Took good care of employees during COVID. The problem I see is with the reward system - focus shifts to the creation of multiple forums and presentations to get visibility from management instead of focusing on the problems.

5.0,Culture is King,"I won't be the first to tell you that interning here is a dream. I absolutely loved my time at Google and everything was honestly great. I only really have 2 complaints:1. My manager seemed to be new to management so he wasn't as helpful as he could have been.2. If you're open about being religious (Christian in my experience), some may ostracize you for it. I was open about my religion but made a point to not push people about it. I ended up being avoided by some other interns and several people who were not on my immediate team which is disappointing but honestly expected."
3.0,Fine workplace,Fine. Enjoyed work but could grow in other places. Did not agree with their values but the work environment was fine. Not a bad place to work but I am moving on 
3.0,Tgif,Not a place where you would think is a good place to work. Way up in the mountains area. Not much of anything to do there. But if it snow its a lot to do during that time

Allows growth in various dimensions apart from core job."
5.0,Grass Is Always Greener,"I loved Google and was there for 5+ years, but was frustrated in my role and took an outside opportunity. MISTAKE - the rest of the work world sucks and I should have never left. "
4.0,Tbd,"Its enjoyable.Alot of big data and metric focused, although it is a data and engineering company. As such not that large of a surprise.That's all.Thank you."
